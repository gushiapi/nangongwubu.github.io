I am currently a [professor](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/gushi/zh_CN/index.htm) in the Department of Computer Science
and Engineering at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). I completed
my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [Dr. Danielle S. Bassett](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=193) 
from the [Complex System Group](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). 
Before that, I spent four years (2007-2011) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) for my undergraduate 
degree in the Academic Talent Program, majoring in mathematics and physics. 
# I am also the co-founder of [APLUX](https://www.aidlux.com/), an innovative company in AIoT. 

### Research Interests
 I am the director of <em><strong>Brain & Intelligence Laboratory</strong></em>, mainly focusing on the interdisciplinary fields between computer science and neuroscience. More specifically, I am interested in the following directions:
1. Develop new frameworks for analyzing brain connectivity with deep graph neural networks. 
2. Develop a new regime of neurofeedback via encoding system identification and control procedure design.
3. Develop appropriate analytical tools for medical imaging analyses.
