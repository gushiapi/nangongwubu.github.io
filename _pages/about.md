I am currently a [professor](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/gushi/zh_CN/index.htm) in the Department of Computer Science
and Engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). I completed
my Ph.D degree under the supervision of [Dr. Danielle S. Bassett](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=193) 
from the [Complex System Group](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). 
Before that, I spent 4 years (2007-2011) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) for my undergraduate 
degree in the Academic Talent Program, majoring in mathematics and physics. I am also the co-founder of [Aplux](http://www.aidlearning.net/index.html), 
an innovative company in AIoT. 

### Research Interests
 I am the director of <em><strong>Brain & Intelligence Laboratory</strong></em>, mainly focusing on the interdisciplinary fileds between computer science and neuroscience. More specifically, I am interested in the following directions:
1. Develop new frameworks of analyzing brain connectivity with deep graph neural networks. 
2. Develop new regime of neurofeedback via encoding system identification and control procedure desgin.
3. Develop appropriate analytical tools for medical imaging analyses.
