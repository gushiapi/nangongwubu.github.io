Cognitive function is driven by dynamic interactions between large-scale neural circuits or networks, enabling behaviour.
However, fundamental principles constraining these dynamic network processes have remained elusive. 
Here we use tools from control and network theories to offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain moves between cognitive states 
and how we can intervene the transition with predictable design.

In network control, the system in question typically comprises a complex web of interacting components, 
and the goal is to drive this networked system towards a desired state by influencing a select number of input nodes. 
The starting point for most control-theoretic problems is the lineartime-invariant 
control system $$\mathbf{x}(t + 1) = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf{u}(t)$$, where $$\mathbf{x}(t)$$ defines the state of the 
system (for example, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal measured by functional 
magnetic resonance imaging), $$\mathbf{A}$$ is the interaction matrix (for example, representing 
white matter tracts estimated using diffusion tensor imaging) and $$\mathbf{u}(t)$$ defines 
the input signal (such as electromagnetic stimulation using transcranial magnetic 
simulation or deep brain simulation). A system is called controllable if it can be 
driven to any desired state. often, however, many naturally occurring networks that 
are theoretically controllable cannot be steered to certain states owing to 
limitations on control resources motivating the introduction of control strategies $$\mathbf{u}^*(t)$$ that 
minimize the norm so-called control energy $$E(\mathbf{u}) = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty}|\mathbf{u}(t)|^2$$, 
where the notation $$|Â·|$$ denotes the $$l^2$$-norm.
